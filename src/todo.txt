State Management
--------------------------

    PLAYERS:
    [] adding player will add a new row (item) and new column (player #)
    [] update name 

    CATEGORIES: 
    [] update name 
    [] add + delete categories 
    [] update scores 
    [] Calculate food average 
    [] Calculate category averegae 

    ITEMS:
    [] update names 

after that see if you can update the category name in the global state by mimicking the pattern to update player names. 
relevant code is
* L190 to of state.js create updatePlayerName actions
* L139 of state.js that uses the updatePlayerName action to update the global state
* and L20 of EditableScoreTable.js that creates & dispatches updatePlayerName actions
